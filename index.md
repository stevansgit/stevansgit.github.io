I'm Steve, a technical writer and content designer. I've been writing about technology and technical things for nearly 20 years... But you can read more about that on my CV page. You can also check out some writing examples, and if you want to get in touch, you can do that, too. 

More seriously, I’m an experienced content professional with a track record of delivering user-centred technical documentation and content design. I’m passionate about translating complex technical information into simple, accurate content that meets user needs.

I'm currently searching for a new full-time role, one I can do either remotely or on a hybrid basis in a Madrid office. I'm happy working on either a permanent or contract basis. 

My skills include: 

**Technical**

Docs-as-code, GitHub, Git, API documentation, release notes, Markdown, HTML, CSS, MadCap Flare, DITA, CI/CD, DevOps, Confluence, Jira, Google Workspace and Microsoft Office.

**Content and design**

User-centered technical documentation, content lifecycle management, content strategy, accessibility, Agile practices, reviewing technical documentation and interviewing technical subject matter experts.

**Management**

Team leadership, mentoring and career progression, stakeholder management, line management and recruitment.

Please do get in touch if you'd like to discuss any job openings, or if you'd just like to connect and have a chat.
