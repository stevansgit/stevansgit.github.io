## Things I've written

### The GOV.UK One Login simulator

This is one of the most rewarding pieces of documentation I've worked on during my career. 

The GOV.UK One Login simulator is a tool that helps teams test their integration with GOV.UK One Login before going live. Before the tool was launched, teams were limited to using test data the One Login team provided, which wasn't very extensive and didn't allow for testing of lots of different scenarios. It was also a slow, manual process.

Due to time constraints with a government department going through the onboarding process, I was brought on the project when a first draft had already been written by the team's awesome developers. I worked with the team to establish timelines and decide what was achievable in the time we had available. We decided to create an MVP out of the draft, to help the user onboard. After that, I would work on a more general version of the documentation for publishing on the main docs site.

The MVP was a simple update of the draft, tailored to the user that was onboarding. Once that had been shared, the baulk of the work started, which was creating a new version for publishing. This meant almost re-starting the documentation, going back to user needs and building from there. 

The developers had documented the feature, not what a user needs to know. For example, the draft contained a lot of background information about how the tool was developed and why certain design decisions were taken. It was definitely interesting information, but not necessarily relevant to users. 

I knew that to be able to fully document the tool from a user's point of view, I needed to understand it much better than I did at the time. 

I had many meetings with the developers and technical architects where we discussed the tool, who it was aimed at, how users would use it, what they would use it for and what part of their journey they would use it in. 

I also experimented with the tool itself, so I was able to document a user’s experience of using it. 

I restructured and rewrote the documentation to cover things like who the feature is for and how to use it. I also greatly expanded the list of API endpoints, to give users a clearer picture of what the tool could do.

Once I’d rewritten the documentation to be more user-focused, I ran user research sessions over Google Meet, where I asked a user to complete some tasks using the documentation. 

Once the new version was peer reviewed and signed-off for publication I published it following our docs-as-code workflow. This means I created the new page for publication in Markdown using VS Code and opened a pull request through GitHub to add it to our documentation site. 

The most satisfying element of this project wasn't getting the work published, it was seizing the opportunity to advocate for technical documentation best practices. I was able to show the value of including technical writers in a project for the start. As a result of my efforts, technical writers are now included in kick-off meetings, which means we’re able to advance documentation understanding and best-practices.
