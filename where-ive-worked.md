## Where I've worked

### Technical Writer, Government Digital Service (GDS) (contract)

April 2024 to present

I'm currently writing user-centred technical documentation for the [GOV.UK One Login service](https://www.sign-in.service.gov.uk), working with developers, technical architects, content designers, user researchers, service designers and other subject matter experts to plan, scope, draft, test and publish documentation.

This includes documentation for the [GOV.UK One Login simulator](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/gov-uk-one-login-simulator/#test-your-service-with-the-gov-uk-one-login-simulator), a tool that lets users test their integration with the GOV.UK One Login service. I worked with developers to better understand the simulator and write a user-centred guide to using it - this included pair writing and asynchronous working. I also tested the documentation with users from other government departments before publishing, so I was confident it met user needs.

I also developed and delivered training for other technical writers to review and approve documentation.

### Senior Content Designer, Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (contract)

September 2023 - April 2024

I worked on a project to update all 226 [Foreign Travel Advice country guides](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice) so they were clearer, more concise and easier to understand.

I also co-developed a template and streamlined publishing process to make rewriting Travel Advice guides easier for non-content designers in the future.

### Lead Technical Writer, The Foundry, Defence Digital (part of the Ministry of Defence)

November 2022 - August 2023

Led workstream to enhance content and documentation for [Foundry services teams](https://www.digital.mod.uk), by writing, reviewing, editing and publishing highly technical, user-focused product and service documentation. Worked closely with developers, technical architects and other subject matter experts to understand the products and services and turned their knowledge into clear and concise technical documentation.

I also implemented a ‘docs-as-code’ approach to publishing content through GitHub, using Markdown and HTML. 

### Lead Technical Writer, GDS and Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO)

August 2019 - October 2022

Increased responsibilities included managing members of the technical writing team, managing the roadmap of upcoming technical guidance and owning and managing the technical content publishing process. This included training technical writers to review documentation and guidance, resulting in a faster approval and publishing process.

I also managed the [Technology in Government blog](https://technology.blog.gov.uk), sourcing, writing and promoting blog posts on the channel. 

### Technical Writer, GDS

April 2017 - August 2019

My main duties were writing technical documentation and technical guidance for various government services. I worked with developers, technical architects, product leads, service managers and user researchers to identify user needs and make sure content was clearly defined.
